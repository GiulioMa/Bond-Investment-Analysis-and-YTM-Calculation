# Bond Investment Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled "Analysis of Investment Returns and Risks in Italian BTP Bonds". The notebook serves as an educational and analytical tool for understanding and calculating the Yield to Maturity (YTM) of bonds and analyzing bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Although the notebook uses an Italian government bond (Buono del Tesoro Poliennale - BTP) expiring in October 2053 as an example, the methodologies and calculations can be applied to a wide range of bond investments.

## Contents
The notebook is structured into several key sections, each focusing on different aspects of bond investment analysis:

1. **Calculating Coupon Payments**: This section explains how to calculate the total coupon payments from an investment in the BTP bond. It covers the formulae for semi-annual coupon payments and the total number of bonds that can be purchased with a given investment amount.

2. **Yield to Maturity (YTM) Calculation**: The notebook delves into the concept of YTM, an essential metric for estimating the total return expected from a bond. It includes detailed steps for calculating the YTM, including the present value formula and considerations for semi-annual coupons.

3. **Bond Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Changes**: This section provides an analysis of how the bond's market price varies under different interest rate scenarios. It demonstrates two approaches for this analysis - direct YTM adjustment and adjusted YTM with a constant coupon rate.

4. **Estimating Profits and Losses**: The final section of the notebook estimates potential profits or losses from bond investments based on varying interest rates. It calculates the change in bond price for different scenarios and assesses the overall impact on investment returns.

## Purpose
The primary aim of this notebook is to showcase how to calculate a bond's YTM and analyze its price sensitivity to interest rate adjustments. While the BTP bond serves as an example, the methodologies and principles outlined are applicable to various types of bonds, making this notebook a valuable resource for investors and students of finance.

## Usage
Users can utilize this notebook to gain a deeper understanding of bond investment dynamics, particularly in scenarios of fluctuating interest rates. It's also a practical guide for calculating returns and risks associated with bond investments.
