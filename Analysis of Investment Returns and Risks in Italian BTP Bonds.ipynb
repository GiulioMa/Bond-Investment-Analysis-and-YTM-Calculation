    "## Calculating Coupon Payments from Bond Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Coupon Payments\n",
    "Coupon payments are the interest payments made by a bond issuer to the bondholders. For the BTP bond, these payments are made semi-annually and are based on the bond's coupon rate and face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Calculate Coupon Payments\n",
    "To calculate the total coupon payments from an investment in the BTP bond, we follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine the Semi-Annual Coupon Payment**:\n",
    "   The semi-annual coupon payment for each bond is calculated as follows:\n",
    "   $$ \\text{Semi-Annual Coupon Payment} = \\frac{\\text{Face Value} \\times \\text{Coupon Rate}}{2} $$\n",
    "   Given that the BTP bond has a face value of €100 and a coupon rate of 4.5%, the formula becomes:\n",
    "   $$ \\text{Semi-Annual Coupon Payment} = \\frac{100 \\times 4.5\\%}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Total Number of Bonds Purchased**:\n",
    "   The number of bonds that can be purchased is determined by dividing the total investment amount by the current price of the bond:\n",
    "   $$ \\text{Number of Bonds} = \\frac{\\text{Investment Amount}}{\\text{Current Bond Price}} $$\n",
    "   It is important to note that the number of bonds should be an integer, as partial bonds cannot be purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Total Coupon Payments**:\n",
    "   The total coupon payments received for the investment is the product of the semi-annual coupon payment per bond and the number of bonds purchased:\n",
    "   $$ \\text{Total Coupon Payments} = \\text{Semi-Annual Coupon Payment} \\times \\text{Number of Bonds} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "- **Investment Horizon**: The analysis assumes that the bonds are held until their maturity date.\n",
    "- **Reinvestment of Coupons**: This calculation does not account for the reinvestment of coupon payments, which could potentially alter the total return on the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will perform these calculations to determine the exact amount of coupon payments an investor can expect from their investment in the BTP bond.\n"

    "## Calculating Yield to Maturity (YTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Yield to Maturity\n",
    "Yield to Maturity (YTM) is a vital financial metric used to estimate the total return expected from a bond if it is held until its maturity. It represents the internal rate of return (IRR) for the bond, factoring in all future coupon payments and the redemption of the face value at maturity, with an assumption that these cash flows are reinvested at a rate equal to the YTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula for YTM Calculation\n",
    "The YTM is the discount rate that equates the present value (PV) of all expected future cash flows from the bond to its current market price. The calculation involves finding the YTM that satisfies the following equation:\n",
    "$$ \\text{Current Bond Price} = \\text{Present Value of Future Cash Flows} $$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "$$ \\text{Present Value of Future Cash Flows} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{C}{(1 + \\frac{YTM}{2})^{i}} + \\frac{F}{(1 + \\frac{YTM}{2})^{N}} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ C $ is the semi-annual coupon payment.\n",
    "- $ YTM $ is the yield to maturity, annualized for semi-annual coupons.\n",
    "- $ N $ is the total number of semi-annual coupon payments until maturity.\n",
    "- $ F $ is the face value of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations\n",
    "- **Semi-Annual Coupons**: The BTP bond pays coupons semi-annually, necessitating the annualization of the YTM and the division of coupon payments into two per year.\n",
    "- **Numerical Solution**: The equation to determine the YTM does not possess a simple algebraic solution and typically requires numerical methods, like the Newton-Raphson method, for its resolution.\n",
    "- **Reinvestment Assumption**: This approach assumes reinvestment of all coupon payments at a constant rate equal to the YTM, an assumption that may not align with actual market conditions or investor behavior.\n"

    "## Analysis of Bond Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Bond Price Sensitivity\n",
    "The relationship between bond prices and interest rates is pivotal in fixed-income investing. This sensitivity analysis is crucial for investors to understand how bond values fluctuate with market interest rate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaches to Analyzing Sensitivity\n",
    "The analysis of bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes can be approached in two ways, both aiming to evaluate how the bond's market price varies under different interest rate scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct YTM Adjustment**: This method involves directly adjusting the bond's yield to maturity (YTM) to reflect changes in market interest rates. The bond price is then recalculated using the new YTM. This approach is straightforward as it directly models the bond's market price response to interest rate fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjusted YTM with Constant Coupon Rate**: An alternative method is to keep the coupon rate constant and adjust the YTM, then find the new bond price that would yield this adjusted YTM. This involves recalculating the YTM for each new interest rate scenario and then determining the corresponding bond price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equivalence and Computational Considerations\n",
    "Both methods ultimately assess how a bond's market price would adjust to different interest rate environments. The direct YTM adjustment method is typically more straightforward computationally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplification**: Adjusting the YTM directly and then recalculating the bond price eliminates the need to solve for the YTM for each rate change scenario.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: This method can be implemented more efficiently using standard financial functions and numerical methods.\n",
    "- **Intuitive Understanding**: Directly observing the changes in bond price with YTM adjustments provides a clear understanding of the bond's interest rate sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bond Price Calculation Formula\n",
    "Regardless of the approach, the bond price for a given YTM is calculated using the present value of future cash flows:\n",
    "$$ \\text{Bond Price} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{C}{(1 + \\frac{YTM}{2})^{i}} + \\frac{F}{(1 + \\frac{YTM}{2})^{N}} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ C $ is the semi-annual coupon payment.\n",
    "- $ YTM $ is the yield to maturity (annualized).\n",
    "- $ N $ is the total number of coupon payments until maturity.\n",
    "- $ F $ is the face value of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will primarily use the direct YTM adjustment approach for its computational efficiency and clarity in illustrating the bond's reaction to varying interest rates.\n"
